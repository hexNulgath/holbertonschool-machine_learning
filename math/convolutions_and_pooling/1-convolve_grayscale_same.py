    performs a same convolution on grayscale images:

    images is a numpy.ndarray with shape (m, h, w)

        m is the number of images
        h is the height in pixels of the images
        w is the width in pixels of the images
    kernel is a numpy.ndarray with shape (kh, kw)

        kh is the height of the kernel
