This project about GANs is organized as follows :

The description contains a crash course about GANs. The fundamentals ideas behind GANs are exposed as fast as possible.
Task 0 : the class Simple_GAN : as they were introduced, GANs are a game played by two adversary players.
Task 1 : the class WGAN_clip : later it appeared that in fact the two players can collaborate.
Task 2 : the class WGANGP : a more natural version of the latter, which outperforms SimpleGANs and WGAN_clips in higher dimensions, as will be illustrated in the main program.
Task 3 : convolutional generators and discriminators : to work with pictures we need to use convolutional neural networks.
Task 4 : our own face generator : we will use a WGAN_GP model to produce faces of persons that donâ€™t exist.
Appendix : at the end of task 4 there is a short digression explaining why GANs are superior to the older generators of fake pictures that were based on PCA.
